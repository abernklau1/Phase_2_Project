# Phase_2_Project

## Summary
**UNFINISHED**
In this project for Flatiron School, Data Science Bootcamp, Drew, Andrew, and Andy explore King's County real estate data to determine the best correlation to sales price of houses as well as model these data in order to back these findings statistically.

## Data
King's County 

## Methods
This project uses a linear regression model with preprocessed data to infer the best option for homeowners to increase the value of their home before selling it. This allows for easy interpretation of which home characteristics to develop and the value the different characteristics add.
